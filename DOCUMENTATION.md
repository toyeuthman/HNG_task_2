## Introduction

CRUD_REST is a RESTful API for managing people. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on person records in a MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

To get started with the API, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB server running (configured in `.env` as `mongoURI`)
- Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
